This DMG is considered Plunging Attack DMG.\\nEach use of Skyladder while in this state increases the DMG and AoE of the next Driftcloud Wave used.\\n\\n<span style=\"color: #FFD780FF;\">Skyladder</span>\\nCan be used while in mid-air. Xianyun leaps forward, dealing <span style=\"color: #80FFD7FF;\">Anemo DMG</span> to targets along her path.\\nDuring each Cloud Transmogrification state Xianyun enters, Skyladder may be used up to 3 times and only 1 instance of Skyladder DMG can be dealt to any one opponent.\\nIf Skyladder is not used again in a short period, the Cloud Transmogrification state will be canceled.\\n\\nIf Xianyun does not use Driftcloud Wave while in this state, the next CD of White Clouds at Dawn will be decreased by 3s.\\n\\n<i>Do not shake Cloud Retainer's hand too tightly; cranes are quite adept at gripping.</i>",
