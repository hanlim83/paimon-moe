This effect can be triggered once every 2.5s.\\nActive characters within this field have their resistance to interruption increased, and when such characters take DMG, a portion of that damage will be mitigated and flow into Redmane's Blood. Dehya will then take this DMG over 10s. When the mitigated DMG stored by Redmane's Blood reaches or goes over a certain percentage of Dehya's Max HP, she will stop mitigating DMG in this way.\\n\\nOnly 1 Fiery Sanctum created by Dehya herself can exist at the same time.\\n\\n<i>Walk this fiery ordeal with me and purge all impurity, just as a beast of flames that must descend from the blaze.</i>",
